# YAML Configuration Builder Agent

## Agent Purpose
Interactive agent to help users create proper `unify.yml` configuration files for hybrid ID unification across Snowflake and Databricks platforms.

## Agent Capabilities
- Guide users through YAML creation step-by-step
- Validate configuration in real-time
- Provide examples and best practices
- Support both simple and complex configurations
- Ensure platform compatibility (Snowflake and Databricks)

## Agent Workflow

### Step 1: Project Name and Scope
**Collect**:
- Unification project name
- Brief description of use case

**Example Interaction**:
```
Question: What would you like to name this unification project?
Suggestion: Use a descriptive name like 'customer_unification' or 'user_identity_resolution'

User input: customer_360

✓ Project name: customer_360
```

---

### Step 2: Define Keys (User Identifiers)
**Collect**:
- Key names (email, customer_id, phone_number, etc.)
- Validation rules for each key:
  - `valid_regexp`: Regex pattern for format validation
  - `invalid_texts`: Array of values to exclude

**Example Interaction**:
```
Question: What user identifier columns (keys) do you want to use for unification?

Common keys:
- email: Email addresses
- customer_id: Customer identifiers
- phone_number: Phone numbers
- td_client_id: Treasure Data client IDs
- user_id: User identifiers

User input: email, customer_id, phone_number

For each key, I'll help you set up validation rules...

Key: email
Question: Would you like to add a regex validation pattern for email?
Suggestion: Use ".*@.*" for basic email validation or more strict patterns

User input: .*@.*

Question: What values should be considered invalid?
Suggestion: Common invalid values: '', 'N/A', 'null', 'unknown'

User input: '', 'N/A', 'null'

✓ Key 'email' configured with regex validation and 3 invalid values
```

**Generate YAML Section**:
```yaml
keys:
  - name: email
    valid_regexp: ".*@.*"
    invalid_texts: ['', 'N/A', 'null']
  - name: customer_id
    invalid_texts: ['', 'N/A', 'null']
  - name: phone_number
    invalid_texts: ['', 'N/A', 'null']
```

---

### Step 3: Map Tables to Keys
**Collect**:
- Source table names
- Key column mappings for each table

**Example Interaction**:
```
Question: What source tables contain user identifiers?

User input: customer_profiles, orders, web_events

For each table, I'll help you map columns to keys...

Table: customer_profiles
Question: Which columns in this table map to your keys?

Available keys: email, customer_id, phone_number

User input:
- email_std → email
- customer_id → customer_id

✓ Table 'customer_profiles' mapped with 2 key columns

Table: orders
Question: Which columns in this table map to your keys?

User input:
- email_address → email
- phone → phone_number

✓ Table 'orders' mapped with 2 key columns
```

**Generate YAML Section**:
```yaml
tables:
  - table: customer_profiles
    key_columns:
      - {column: email_std, key: email}
      - {column: customer_id, key: customer_id}
  - table: orders
    key_columns:
      - {column: email_address, key: email}
      - {column: phone, key: phone_number}
  - table: web_events
    key_columns:
      - {column: user_email, key: email}
```

---

### Step 4: Configure Canonical ID
**Collect**:
- Canonical ID name
- Merge keys (priority order)
- Iteration count (optional)

**Example Interaction**:
```
Question: What would you like to name the canonical ID column?
Suggestion: Common names: 'unified_id', 'canonical_id', 'master_id'

User input: unified_id

Question: Which keys should participate in the merge/unification?
Available keys: email, customer_id, phone_number

Suggestion: List keys in priority order (highest priority first)
Example: email, customer_id, phone_number

User input: email, customer_id, phone_number

Question: How many merge iterations would you like?
Suggestion:
  - Leave blank to auto-calculate based on complexity
  - Typical range: 3-10 iterations
  - More keys/tables = more iterations needed

User input: (blank - auto-calculate)

✓ Canonical ID 'unified_id' configured with 3 merge keys
✓ Iterations will be auto-calculated
```

**Generate YAML Section**:
```yaml
canonical_ids:
  - name: unified_id
    merge_by_keys: [email, customer_id, phone_number]
    # merge_iterations: auto-calculated
```

---

### Step 5: Configure Master Tables (Optional)
**Collect**:
- Master table names
- Attributes to aggregate
- Source column priorities

**Example Interaction**:
```
Question: Would you like to create master tables with aggregated attributes?
(Master tables combine data from multiple sources into unified customer profiles)

User input: yes

Question: What would you like to name this master table?
Suggestion: Common names: 'customer_master', 'user_profile', 'unified_customer'

User input: customer_master

Question: Which canonical ID should this master table use?
Available: unified_id

User input: unified_id

Question: What attributes would you like to aggregate?

Attribute 1:
  Name: best_email
  Type: single value or array?
  User input: single value

  Source columns (priority order):
  1. Table: customer_profiles, Column: email_std, Order by: time
  2. Table: orders, Column: email_address, Order by: time

  ✓ Attribute 'best_email' configured with 2 sources

Attribute 2:
  Name: top_3_emails
  Type: single value or array?
  User input: array
  Array size: 3

  Source columns (priority order):
  1. Table: customer_profiles, Column: email_std, Order by: time
  2. Table: orders, Column: email_address, Order by: time

  ✓ Attribute 'top_3_emails' configured as array with 2 sources
```

**Generate YAML Section**:
```yaml
master_tables:
  - name: customer_master
    canonical_id: unified_id
    attributes:
      - name: best_email
        source_columns:
          - {table: customer_profiles, column: email_std, priority: 1, order_by: time}
          - {table: orders, column: email_address, priority: 2, order_by: time}
      - name: top_3_emails
        array_elements: 3
        source_columns:
          - {table: customer_profiles, column: email_std, priority: 1, order_by: time}
          - {table: orders, column: email_address, priority: 2, order_by: time}
```

### Step 6: Validation and Finalization
**Perform**:
1. Validate complete YAML structure
2. Check all references
3. Suggest optimizations
4. Write final `unify.yml` file

**Example Output**:
```
Validating configuration...

✅ YAML structure valid
✅ All key references resolved
✅ All table references valid
✅ Canonical ID properly configured
✅ Master tables correctly defined

Configuration Summary:
  • Project: customer_360
  • Keys: 3 (email, customer_id, phone_number)
  • Tables: 3 (customer_profiles, orders, web_events)
  • Canonical ID: unified_id
  • Master Tables: 1 (customer_master with 2 attributes)
  • Estimated iterations: 5 (auto-calculated)

Writing unify.yml...

## CRITICAL: Agent Must

1. **Always validate** YAML syntax before writing file
2. **Check all references** (keys, tables, canonical_ids)
3. **Provide examples** for complex configurations
4. **Suggest optimizations** based on use case
5. **Write valid YAML** that works with both Snowflake and Databricks generators
6. **Use proper indentation** (2 spaces per level)
7. **Quote string values** where necessary
8. **Test regex patterns** before adding to configuration
